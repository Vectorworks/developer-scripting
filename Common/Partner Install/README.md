# Install Partner Products

Vectorworks 2021 introduced a feature called 'Install Partner Products' (as a menu command under the Help menu) that allows users to browse and install features from third-party developers.

The Install Partner Products feature works with packages, provided by the developer, and uploaded on Vectorworks online storage. More information about how these packages are structured and how the system works, you can find in the [Partner Product Install Package](pages/Partner%20Product%20Install%20Package.md) article.

As a developer, if you are interested in listing your products/features there, please contact us at [devsupport@vectorworks.net](mailto:devsupport@vectorworks.net).

Before releaseing plugins you should [Prepare the script plugins for release](pages/PrepareReleasePlugins.md).

## Obsolete Installing Scripts

The old way of installing has been deprecated. Information on it can be found in the deprecated section of [Vectorworks 2023 Development](../Versions/Vectorworks%202023.md)
