# Vectorworks Scripting

Vectorworks provides two options for scripting: Python (as of Vectorworks 2014) and VectorScript.

## Marionette Scripting

Marionette is a graphical programming language for Vectorworks. It allows the user to generate and manipulate VW objects without learning a traditional text based language.

* [Marionette Implement a Node](Marionette/pages/Implement%20a%20Node.md)
* [Marionette Node Reference](Marionette/pages/Node%20Reference.md) (Work in progress)
* [Python Package Catalog](Marionette/pages/Python%20Package%20Catalog.md)

## Python Scripting

Vectorworks 2014 adds Python (http://www.python.org) language as an alternative to VectorScript for creating menu commands, objects, tools, or general purpose scripts.

You can go to the [Python page](Python/README.md) for more information.

## VectorScript

[VectorScript](VectorScript/README.md) is a Pascal-like language allowing scripting in Vectorworks.

## Plugin Credential files

Vectorworks 2026 introduces the requirement for script plugins that are encrypted/obfuscated and SDK plugins to have a satellite credentials file that defines who is the developer of the plugins is.
