## What is VectorScript

VectorScript is a scripting language component of the Vectorworks® Fundamentals software package. It is a lightweight programming language which syntactically resembles Pascal, incorporating many of the programming constructs of that language.

## Language Guide

VectorScript is actually a “superset” of the Pascal language, extending basic Pascal capabilities with a number of APIs (application programming interfaces) which provide access to the features and functionality of the Vectorworks CAD engine.

Please, download and read the [VectorScript Language Guide PDF](VectorScript Language Guide.pdf) document for more information.
